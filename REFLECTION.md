# Reflection â€“ Math Toolkit Project

### What patterns or surprises did you notice?

I noticed how small logic changes affect function output. Using modulo helped me understand remainders better. I also saw patterns in using the return statement consistently.

---

### What logic challenged your thinking?

Using even/odd logic with negative numbers or zero made me double-check how the `%` operator behaves. Testing made it easier to confirm logic worked as expected.

---

### How might this kind of toolkit be used in the real world?

A math toolkit like this could help in building calculators, games, or backend data validation. Simple functions are building blocks for larger systems.

### What did you learn about functions and Git?

I learned how to break problems into small reusable parts with functions. I also practiced using Git to track changes and organize my work. Commits helped me document each stage clearly.
